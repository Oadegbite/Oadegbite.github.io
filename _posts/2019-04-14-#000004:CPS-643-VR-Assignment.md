<p>Shader Experiment and Interactive Music Vizualizations</p>
<p>Authors: Tomi Adegbite & Ryan Woodworth</p>
<p>This project was an exploration of shaders and interactive music visualization. There is a lobby scene and two interactive music rooms. The first is a mainly experience room that visualizes the full music spectrum as well as the different bands and displays them as part of the environment while being able to use the controllers pad to change elements of the song. The second room is a room with an interactive xylophone that will visualize the notes played using a detailed water texture, the different notes represent a change in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochoidal_wave">gerstner waves</a> and multiple notes will be added together to create different waves shapes.</p>
