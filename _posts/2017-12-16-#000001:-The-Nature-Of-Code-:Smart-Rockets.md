<p> Two populations of evolving smart rockets made with the help of <a href="http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/">Chapter 9</a> of the amazing <a href="http://natureofcode.com/book/">Nature Of Code Book</a>.</p>
<p>Code on <a href="https://github.com/Oadegbite/Oadegbite.github.io/tree/master/projects/TheNatureOfCode/E9_10SmartRockets">Github</a></p>

<h2><u>The Idea:</u></h2>
<p>To use a genetic algorith to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Done though two populations of ships that can navigate to a target place at multiple locations.</p>

<p><u>The variables:</u></p>
<p><em>Generation:</em> Number of generations since start of scene.</p>
<p>Population Fitness: The average fitness of the population, fitness being the method of selection based on how close the ship gets to the target.</p>
<p>Life: The amount of time till death and start of new generation. </p>
<p>Population Size: Number of ships in the population.</p>
<p>Mutation Rate: The rate at which new directions are added to ships DNA to test for other methods of raising fitness.</p>
<h2><u>The Implementation:</u></h2>
<p></p>

<h2><u>The Conclusion:</u></h2>
